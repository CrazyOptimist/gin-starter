# This contains Go code that is strictly for use internally within this codebase. Note that there is a strict standard that Go code in this directory cannot be referenced by Go code in another repository so do not place code that contains types which could be useful to reference from another service (eg when using gRPC, the consumer typically consumes the Protobuf definitions from the provider repository â€” do not put your Protobuf codegen-ed files in here or the consumer will not be able to reference them)
